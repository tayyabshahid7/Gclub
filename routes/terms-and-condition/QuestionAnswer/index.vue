IT PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIM RELATING THIS AGREEMENT, THE WEBSITE, YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT, OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. IN ARBITRATION, NEITHER YOU NOR G|CLUBS WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT, OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THE CLAIMS. CLAIMS MAY BE ARBITRATED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PRE-HEARING DISCOVERY RIGHTS AND POST-HEARING APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED, BUT THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS PERMITTED UNDER THESE TERMS.

Any Disputes between you and G|CLUBS shall be resolved through binding arbitration; except that, if you are a U.S. resident, you may assert claims in small claims court (if such claims qualify).

            Any arbitration between you and G|CLUBS shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if you resides in the United States and JAMS’ International Arbitration Rules if you reside outside the United States, to the extent that those rules do not conflict with this provision. You may obtain a copy of these rules by contacting JAMS at 1-800-352-5267, by writing to JAMS at 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018 or online at www.jamsadr.com or www.jamsinternational.com/.

BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND G|CLUBS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will take place before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall (i) be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, with the specific manner chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; and (ii) not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. The arbitrator will be mutually agreed upon by you and G|CLUBS. If you and G|CLUBS cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed according to JAMS procedures. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION YOU AND G|CLUBS BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
